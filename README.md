# 🔁 Text2Cypher: Natural Language to Cypher Query Generation with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

**Text2Cypher** is a research project focused on translating natural language questions into executable Cypher queries for graph databases like Neo4j. The project leverages large language models (LLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve the accuracy, interpretability, and robustness of query generation in structured environments.

---

## Goals

- Evaluate the effectiveness of **Chain-of-Thought reasoning** in structured graph querying.
- Build a robust dataset for the **Text-to-Cypher** task.
